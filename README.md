For this project, we will be generally working to understand the results of callcenter data to see the critiques we mentioned above.

We will use "us_call_center_data.csv" data including the customer calls from various United States' cities. 

You can find our data in our resources section. By the way you can use your company's own call center data for this project.

## Usage
In this project our goal is to work through PowerBI to help the company understand some problems if they need to such as:
